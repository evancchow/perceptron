Perceptron Learning Algorithm, Primal and Dual Forms
==========

This repo contains a quick Python implmementation and demo of the primal form of a perceptron learning algorithm. Might be slightly buggy; the weights and biases don't come out correctly right now. Will also push the dual version after debugging.
