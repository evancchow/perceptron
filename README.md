Perceptron Learning Algorithm, Primal and Dual Forms
==========

Wikipedia: "In machine learning, the perceptron is an algorithm for supervised classification of an input into one of several possible non-binary outputs. It is a type of linear classifier, i.e. a classification algorithm that makes its predictions based on a linear predictor function combining a set of weights with the feature vector. The algorithm allows for online learning, in that it processes elements in the training set one at a time."

A quick video of the perceptron algorithm in action can be seen at:

This repo contains a quick Python implementation and demo of the primal form of a perceptron learning algorithm. Might be slightly buggy; the weights and biases don't come out correctly right now. Will also push the dual version after further debugging.
